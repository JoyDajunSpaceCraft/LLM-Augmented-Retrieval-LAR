# LLM-Augmented Retrieval (LAR) System
The LLM-Augmented Retrieval (LAR) system is an innovative approach that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), like Llama and ChatGPT, to enhance search capabilities. It integrates LLMs with search engines, allowing for refined query processing and improved search results.


### Changelog
- [x] Initial commit

## Features
+ **Query Dissection**: Uses LLMs to break down broad user queries into specific sub-queries.
+ **External Knowledge Retrieval** : Processes refined queries through a retrieval model, extracting information from external knowledge sources.
+ **Feedback Mechanism**: Incorporates user feedback on search results to refine LLM outputs, serving as a fact-checking tool.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/LAR-system.git
cd LAR-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the LAR system:



2. Input your broad query when prompted.

3. Review the refined search results.

4. Provide feedback as necessary to refine the search further.
